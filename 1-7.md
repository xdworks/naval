# Find a Position of Leverage

找到一个有杠杆作用的位置

We live in an age of infinite leverage, and the economic rewards for genuine intellectual curiosity have never been higher. [11] Following your genuine intellectual curiosity is a better foundation for a career than following whatever is making money right now. [11]

我们生活在一个拥有无限杠杆的时代，真正的求知欲所带来的经济回报从未像现在这样高过。追随你真正的求知欲比追随当下能赚钱的东西更能为职业打下更好的基础。

Knowledge only you know or only a small set of people knows is going to come out of your passions and your hobbies, oddly enough. If you have hobbies around your intellectual curiosity, you’re more likely to develop these passions. [1]

奇怪的是，只有你知道的知识或者只有一小部分人知道的知识会来自你的热情和爱好。如果你对自己的求知欲有兴趣，你就更有可能培养这些激情。

If it entertains you now but will bore you someday, it’s a distraction. Keep looking.

如果它现在让你开心，但有一天会让你厌烦，那就是让你分心。继续找。

I only really want to do things for their own sake. That is one definition of art. Whether it’s business, exercise, romance, friendship, whatever, I think the meaning of life is to do things for their own sake. Ironically, when you do things for their own sake, you create your best work. Even if you’re just trying to make money, you will actually be the most successful.

我真的只想为自己着想。这是艺术的一个定义。无论是生意、锻炼、浪漫还是友谊，我认为人生的意义就是为自己做事。具有讽刺意味的是，当你为他们自己做事时，你创造了你最好的作品。即使你只是想赚钱，实际上你也会是最成功的。

The year I generated the most wealth for myself was actually the year I worked the least hard and cared the least about the future. I was mostly doing things for the sheer fun of it. I was basically telling people, “I’m retired, I’m not working.” Then, I had the time for whatever was my highest valued project in front of me. By doing things for their own sake, I did them at their best. [74]

我为自己创造最多财富的那一年，实际上也是我最不努力工作、最不关心未来的一年。我做这些事主要是为了纯粹的乐趣。我基本上是在告诉人们，“我退休了，我不工作了。”然后，我有时间做摆在我面前的任何我最看重的项目。通过为他们自己做事，我尽了最大努力。“[74]

The less you want something, the less you’re thinking about it, the less you’re obsessing over it, the more you’re going to do it in a natural way. The more you’re going to do it for yourself. You’re going to do it in a way you’re good at, and you’re going to stick with it. The people around you will see the quality of your work is higher. [1]

你想要的东西越少，你想的就越少，你对它的执着就越少，你就会更自然地去做它。你就越想为自己做这件事。你要用你擅长的方式去做，并且要坚持下去。你周围的人会看到你的工作质量更高。

Follow your intellectual curiosity more than whatever is “hot” right now. If your curiosity ever leads you to a place where society eventually wants to go, you’ll get paid extremely well. [3]

更多地追随你的求知欲，而不是现在任何“热门”的东西。如果你的好奇心曾经把你带到一个社会最终想去的地方，你会得到非常丰厚的报酬。

You’re more likely to have skills society does not yet know how to train other people to do. If someone can train other people how to do something, then they can replace you. If they can replace you, then they don’t have to pay you a lot. You want to know how to do something other people don’t know how to do at the time period when those skills are in demand. [1]

你更有可能拥有社会还不知道如何训练其他人去做的技能。如果有人能训练别人怎么做，那么他们就能取代你。如果他们能取代你，那么他们就不必付给你很多钱。你想知道如何在需要这些技能的时候做别人不知道该怎么做的事情。

If they can train you to do it, then eventually they will train a computer to do it.

如果他们能训练你做这件事，那么最终他们会训练一台计算机去做这件事。

You get rewarded by society for giving it what it wants and doesn’t know how to get elsewhere. A lot of people think you can go to school and study for how to make money, but the reality is, there’s no skill called “business.” [1]

你得到了社会的奖励，因为你给了它想要的东西，而不知道如何从其他地方得到。很多人认为你可以去学校学习如何赚钱，但现实是，没有什么技能叫做“生意”。

Think about what product or service society wants but does not yet know how to get. You want to become the person who delivers it and delivers it at scale. That is really the challenge of how to make money.

想一想社会想要什么产品或服务，但还不知道如何获得。你想成为交付它的人，并按规模交付它。这确实是如何赚钱的挑战。

Now, the problem is becoming good at whatever “it” is. It moves around from generation to generation, but a lot of it happens to be in technology.

现在，无论“它”是什么，问题都变得很好了。它代代相传，但其中很多恰好是在技术领域。

You are waiting for your moment when something emerges in the world, they need a skill set, and you’re uniquely qualified. You build your brand in the meantime on Twitter, on YouTube, and by giving away free work. You make a name for yourself, and you take some risk in the process. When it is time to move on the opportunity, you can do so with leverage—the maximum leverage possible. [1]

你在等待你的时刻，世界上出现了一些东西，他们需要一套技能，而你是独一无二的合格人才。在此期间，你可以在Twitter、YouTube和免费作品上建立自己的品牌。你让自己声名鹊起，在这个过程中你承担了一些风险。当是时候抓住机会时，你可以用杠杆-尽可能的最大杠杆-来做到这一点。


There are three broad classes of leverage:
杠杆分为三大类：

One form of leverage is labor— other humans working for you. It is the oldest form of leverage, and actually not a great one in the modern world. [1] I would argue this is the worst form of leverage that you could possibly use. Managing other people is incredibly messy. It requires tremendous leadership skills. You’re one short hop from a mutiny or getting eaten or torn apart by the mob. [78]

一种杠杆形式是劳动--其他为你工作的人。这是最古老的杠杆形式，实际上在现代世界中并不是一种伟大的杠杆形式。[1]我认为这是你可能使用的最糟糕的杠杆形式。管理其他人是一件令人难以置信的杂乱无章的事情。这需要极强的领导能力。你离兵变或被暴徒吃掉或撕裂只有一步之遥。

Money is good as a form of leverage. It means every time you make a decision, you multiply it with money. [1] Capital is a trickier form of leverage to use. It’s more modern. It’s the one that people have used to get fabulously wealthy in the last century. It’s probably been the dominant form of leverage in the last century.

钱作为一种杠杆是好的。这意味着你每做一次决定，你就会把它与金钱相乘。)[1]资本是一种更难使用的杠杆形式。它更现代一些。在上个世纪，人们用它来获得惊人的财富。在上个世纪，它可能一直是占主导地位的杠杆形式。

You can see this by looking for the richest people. It’s bankers, politicians in corrupt countries who print money, essentially people who move large amounts of money around. If you look at the top of very large companies, outside of technology companies, in many, many large old companies, the CEO job is really a financial job.

你可以通过寻找最富有的人来看到这一点。是银行家、腐败国家的政客印制钞票，本质上是转移大量钞票的人。如果你看看非常大的公司的高层，除了科技公司，在很多很多大型的老公司中，首席执行官的工作实际上是一项金融工作。

It scales very, very well. If you get good at managing capital, you can manage more and more capital much more easily than you can manage more and more people. [78]

它的伸缩性非常非常好。如果你善于管理资本，你管理越来越多的资本就比管理越来越多的人容易得多。“[78]

The final form of leverage is brand new—the most democratic form. It is: “products with no marginal cost of replication.” This includes books, media, movies, and code. Code is probably the most powerful form of permissionless leverage. All you need is a computer—you don’t need anyone’s permission. [1]

杠杆的最终形式是全新的--最民主的形式。它是：“没有边际复制成本的产品。”这包括书籍、媒体、电影和代码。代码可能是最强大的未经许可的杠杆形式。你所需要的只是一台电脑--你不需要任何人的许可。

Forget rich versus poor, white -collar versus blue. It’s now leveraged versus un -leveraged .
忘了富人和穷人、白领和蓝领吧。现在，它是杠杆化的，而不是非杠杆化的。

The most interesting and the most important form of leverage is the idea of products that have no marginal cost of replication. This is the new form of leverage. This was only invented in the last few hundred years. It started with the printing press. It accelerated with broadcast media, and now it’s really blown up with the internet and with coding. Now, you can multiply your efforts without involving other humans and without needing money from other humans.

最有趣和最重要的杠杆形式是没有边际复制成本的产品的想法。这就是新的杠杆形式。这是近几百年来才发明的。它始于印刷机。它随着广播媒体的发展而加速，现在它真的随着互联网和编码而爆炸。现在，你可以在不涉及其他人的情况下加倍努力，也不需要其他人的钱。

This book is a form of leverage. Long ago, I would have had to sit in a lecture hall and lecture each of you personally. I would have maybe reached a few hundred people, and that would have been that. [78]

这本书是一种杠杆。很久以前，我必须坐在演讲厅里亲自给你们每个人讲课。我可能会接触到几百人，那就是这样。“[78]
This newest form of leverage is where all the new fortunes are made, all the new billionaires. For the last generation, fortunes were made by capital. The people who made fortunes were the Warren Buffetts of the world.

这种最新形式的杠杆是所有新财富、所有新亿万富翁的发源地。在上一代人中，财富是由资本创造的。发家致富的人是世界上的沃伦·巴菲特(Warren Buffetts)。

But the new generation’s fortunes are all made through code or media. Joe Rogan making $50 million to $100 million a year from his podcast. You’re going to have PewDiePie. I don’t know how much money he’s rolling in, but he’s bigger than the news. And of course, there’s Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs. Their wealth is all code -based leverage. [78]

但新一代的财富都是通过代码或媒体创造的。乔·罗根(Joe Rogan)每年从他的播客中赚取5000万至1亿美元。你要吃PewDiePie。我不知道他赚了多少钱，但他比新闻更重要。当然，还有杰夫·贝佐斯、马克·扎克伯格、拉里·佩奇、谢尔盖·布林、比尔·盖茨和史蒂夫·乔布斯。他们的财富都是基于代码的杠杆。

Probably the most interesting thing to keep in mind about new forms of leverage is they are permissionless. They don’t require somebody else’s permission for you to use them or succeed. For labor leverage, somebody has to decide to follow you. For capital leverage, somebody has to give you money to invest or to turn into a product.

关于新的杠杆形式，最有趣的可能是它们是未经许可的。它们不需要别人的许可，您就可以使用它们或取得成功。对于劳动力杠杆，必须有人决定追随你。对于资本杠杆，必须有人给你钱来投资或转化为产品。

Coding, writing books, recording podcasts, tweeting, YouTubing—these kinds of things are permissionless. You don’t need anyone’s permission to do them, and that’s why they are very egalitarian. They’re great equalizers of leverage. [78] Every great software developer, for example, now has an army of robots working for him at nighttime while he or she sleeps, after they’ve written the code, and it’s cranking away. [78]

编码、写书、录制播客、发推特、YouTube--这些事情都是未经许可的。你不需要任何人的许可就可以这么做，这就是为什么他们非常平等主义的原因。他们是很好的杠杆均衡器。例如，现在每个伟大的软件开发人员，现在都有一支机器人大军，在他或她睡觉的时候，在他们写完代码后，为他工作，而且它正在转动。

You’re never going to get rich renting out your time.
把你的时间租出去，你永远不会发财的。

Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay. If you have independence and you’re accountable on your output, as opposed to your input—that’s the dream. [10]
在生活中，只要你能做到这一点，就优化你的独立性，而不是付钱。如果你有独立性，对你的产出负责，而不是对你的投入负责--这就是你的梦想。

Humans evolved in societies where there was no leverage. If I was chopping wood or carrying water for you, you knew eight hours put in would be equal to about eight hours of output. Now we’ve invented leverage—through capital, cooperation, technology, productivity, all these means. We live in an age of leverage. As a worker, you want to be as leveraged as possible so you have a huge impact without as much time or physical effort.

人类是在没有筹码的社会中进化的。如果我为你劈柴或提水，你就知道投入八个小时就相当于产出八个小时。现在我们发明了杠杆-通过资本、合作、技术、生产力，所有这些手段。我们生活在一个杠杆化的时代。作为一名员工，你想要尽可能地发挥杠杆作用，这样你就可以在没有太多时间或体力的情况下产生巨大的影响。

A leveraged worker can out -produce a non -leveraged worker by a factor of one thousand or ten thousand. With a leveraged worker, judgment is far more important than how much time they put in or how hard they work.

杠杆工人的产量可能比非杠杆工人高出一千倍或一万倍。对于杠杆员工来说，判断比他们投入了多少时间或工作有多努力要重要得多。

Forget 10x programmers. 1,000x programmers really exist, we just don’t fully acknowledge it. See @ID_AA_Carmack, @notch, Satoshi Nakomoto, etc.
忘了10倍的程序员吧。1000x程序员确实存在，只是我们没有完全认识到而已。参见@ID_AA_CAMMACK、@NOTCH、中本聪等。

For example, a good software engineer, just by writing the right little piece of code and creating the right little application, can literally create half a billion dollars’ worth of value for a company. But ten engineers working ten times as hard, just because they choose the wrong model, the wrong product, wrote it the wrong way, or put in the wrong viral loop, have basically wasted their time. Inputs don’t match outputs, especially for leveraged workers.

例如，一个优秀的软件工程师，仅仅通过编写正确的小代码和创建正确的小应用程序，就可以真正为一家公司创造5亿美元的价值。但是十位工程师付出了十倍的努力，仅仅因为他们选择了错误的型号，错误的产品，错误的书写方式，或者进入了错误的病毒式循环，基本上就浪费了他们的时间。输入与输出不匹配，特别是对于杠杆工人而言。

What you want in life is to be in control of your time. You want to get into a leveraged job where you control your own time and you’re tracked on the outputs. If you do something incredible to move the needle on the business, they have to pay you. Especially if they don’t know how you did it because it’s innate to your obsession or your skill or your innate abilities, they’re going to have to keep paying you to do it.

你在生活中想要的是控制你的时间。你想要进入一份杠杆工作，在那里你可以控制自己的时间，并且你的输出会被跟踪。如果你做了令人难以置信的事情，他们必须付钱给你。特别是如果他们不知道你是如何做到这一点的，因为这是你的痴迷、你的技能或你天生的能力，他们将不得不继续付钱让你做这件事。

If you have specific knowledge, you have accountability and you have leverage; they have to pay you what you’re worth. If they pay you what you’re worth, then you can get your time back—you can be hyper -efficient . You’re not doing meetings for meetings’ sake, you’re not trying to impress other people, you’re not writing things down to make it look like you did work. All you care about is the actual work itself.

如果你有具体的知识，你就有责任，你有杠杆；他们必须按你的价值付给你。如果他们付给你应得的报酬，那么你就可以拿回你的时间--你可以变得超级高效。你不是为了开会而开会，你不是为了给别人留下深刻印象，你不是为了让人觉得你确实在工作而把事情写下来。你所关心的只是实际工作本身。

When you do just the actual work itself, you’ll be far more productive, far more efficient. You’ll work when you feel like it—when you’re high -energy —and you won’t be trying to struggle through when you’re low energy. You’ll gain your time back.

当你只做实际的工作时，你会有更多的生产力和更高的效率。当你精力充沛的时候，你会在你想工作的时候工作，而当你精力充沛的时候，你就不会试图挣扎着度过难关。你会拿回你的时间的。

Forty hour work weeks are a relic of the Industrial Age. Knowledge workers function like athletes—train and sprint, then rest and reassess.

每周工作40小时是工业时代的遗迹。知识型员工的功能就像运动员一样--训练和冲刺，然后休息和重新评估。

Sales is an example—especially very high -end sales. If you’re a real estate agent out there selling houses, it’s not a great job, necessarily. It’s very crowded. But if you’re a top -tier real estate agent, you know how to market yourself and you know how to sell houses, it’s possible you could sell $5 million mansions in one tenth of the time while somebody else is struggling to sell $100,000 apartments or condos. Real estate agent is a job with input and output disconnected.
销售就是一个例子，特别是非常高端的销售。如果你是一名房地产经纪人，在外面卖房子，这不一定是一份很好的工作。非常拥挤。但如果你是一名顶级房地产经纪人，你知道如何推销自己，知道如何卖房子，你可能会在十分之一的时间里卖出500万美元的豪宅，而其他人却在努力卖出10万美元的公寓或公寓。房地产经纪人是一种投入产出脱节的工作。

Building any product and selling any product fits this description. And fundamentally, what else is there? Where you don’t necessarily want to be is a support role, like customer service. In customer service, unfortunately, inputs and outputs relate relatively close to each other, and the hours you put in matter. [10]
构建任何产品和销售任何产品都符合这一描述。从根本上说，还有什么呢？你不一定想做的是支持角色，比如客户服务。不幸的是，在客户服务中，投入和产出的关系相对密切，你投入的时间很重要。

Tools and leverage create this disconnection between inputs and outputs. The higher the creativity component of a profession, the more likely it is to have disconnected inputs and outputs. If you’re looking at professions where your inputs and your outputs are highly connected, it’s going to be very hard to create wealth and make wealth for yourself in that process. [78]
工具和杠杆造成了输入和输出之间的这种脱节。一个职业的创造力成分越高，其投入和产出脱节的可能性就越大。如果你看的是那些你的投入和产出高度相关的职业，那么在这个过程中为自己创造财富并为自己创造财富将是非常困难的。“[78]
If you want to be part of a great tech company, then you need to be able to SELL or BUILD. If you don’t do either, learn.

如果你想成为一家伟大的科技公司的一部分，那么你需要能够出售或建立。如果你两者都不做，那就学习吧。

Learn to sell, learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.
学会销售，学会建造。如果你两个都能做到，你就势不可挡了。

These are two very broad categories. One is building the product. This is hard, and it’s multivariate. It can include design; it can include development; it can include manufacturing, logistics, procurement; and it can even be designing and operating a service. It has many, many definitions.

这是两个非常广泛的类别。一个是制造产品。这很难，而且是多元的。它可以包括设计；可以包括开发；可以包括制造、物流、采购；甚至可以是设计和运营服务。它有很多很多的定义。

But in every industry, there is a definition of the builder. In our tech industry, it’s the CTO, it’s the programmer, it’s the software engineer or hardware engineer. But even in the laundry business, it could be the person who’s building the laundry service, who is making the trains run on time, who’s making sure all the clothes end up in the right place at the right time, and so on.
但在每个行业，都有对建造者的定义。在我们的技术行业中，它是首席技术官，它是程序员，它是软件工程师或硬件工程师。但即使是在洗衣业，也可能是建立洗衣服务的人，让火车准时运行的人，确保所有衣服在正确的时间到达正确的地点的人，等等。

The other side of it is sales. Again, selling has a very broad definition. Selling doesn’t necessarily just mean selling to individual customers, but it can mean marketing, it can mean communicating, it can mean recruiting, it can mean raising money, it can mean inspiring people, it could mean doing PR. It’s a broad umbrella category. [78]
它的另一面是销售。同样，销售的定义非常宽泛。销售不一定意味着向个人客户销售，但它可以是营销，可以是沟通，可以是招聘，可以是筹集资金，可以是鼓舞人心，也可以是做公关。这是一个宽泛的伞形类别。

Earn with your mind, not your time.

用你的头脑而不是你的时间来挣钱。

Let’s talk more about the real estate business. The worst kind of job is someone who’s doing labor to repair a house. Maybe you get paid ten dollars or twenty dollars an hour. You go to people’s houses, your boss demands you’re there at 8:00 a.m., and you repair your piece of the house. Here, you have zero leverage. You have some accountability, but not really, because your accountability is to your boss, not to the client. You don’t have any real specific knowledge, since what you’re doing is labor lots of people can do. You’re not going to get paid a lot. You’re getting paid minimum wage plus a little bit for your skill and your time.

让我们更多地谈谈房地产业务吧。最糟糕的工作是一个人在做修缮房子的劳动。也许你的工资是每小时10美元或20美元。你去别人家里，你的老板要求你早上8点到那里，然后你修理房子的一部分。在这里，你没有杠杆。你有一些责任，但不是真的，因为你的责任是对你的老板，而不是对客户。你没有任何真正的专门知识，因为你所做的是很多人都能做的劳动。你不会拿到很多钱的。你可以拿到最低工资，外加一点作为你的技能和时间的报酬。

The next level up might be the general contractor working on the house for the owner. They may be getting paid $50,000 to do the whole project, then they’re paying the labor fifteen dollars an hour and they’re keeping the difference.

下一层可能是为业主修缮房屋的总承包商。他们完成整个项目可能会得到5万美元的报酬，然后他们付给工人每小时15美元，他们会保留差额。

A general contractor is obviously a better place to be. But how do we measure it? How do we know it’s better? Well, we know it’s better because this person has some accountability. They’re responsible for the outcome, they have to sweat at night if things aren’t working. Contractors have leverage through laborers working for them. They also have little bit more specific knowledge: how to organize a team, make them show up on time, and how to deal with city regulations.

总承包商显然是一个更好的选择。但是我们如何衡量它呢？我们怎么知道这样更好呢？嗯，我们知道这样更好，因为这个人有一定的责任感。他们要对结果负责，如果事情不顺利，他们必须在晚上出汗。承包商通过为他们工作的劳工拥有影响力。他们也有一些更具体的知识：如何组织团队，让他们准时出现，以及如何处理城市规定。

The next level up might be a real estate developer. A developer is someone who’s going to buy a property, hire a bunch of contractors, and transform it into something higher value. They probably have to take out a loan to buy a house or go to investors to raise money. They buy the old house, tear it down, rebuild it, and sell it. Instead of $50,000 like the general contractor, or fifteen dollars an hour like the laborer, the developer might be able to make a million dollars or half a million dollars in profit when they sell the house for more than they bought it for, including the expenses of construction. But now, notice what is required from the developer: a very high level of accountability.

下一层可能是房地产开发商。开发商是这样的人，他们打算购买一处房产，雇佣一群承包商，然后把它改造成更高价值的东西。他们可能不得不贷款买房，或者去找投资者融资。他们买下这座老房子，拆掉它，重建它，然后把它卖了。开发商不像总承包商那样是5万美元，也不是像工人那样每小时15美元，而是当他们以高于购买价格的价格出售房屋时，包括建筑费用在内，他们可能能够赚取100万美元或50万美元的利润。但是现在，请注意对开发人员的要求：非常高级别的责任。

The developer takes on more risk, more accountability, has more leverage, and needs to have more specific knowledge. They need to understand fundraising, city regulations, where the real estate market is headed, and whether they should take the risk or not. It is more difficult.

开发人员承担更多风险，承担更多责任，拥有更多杠杆，需要有更具体的知识。他们需要了解资金筹集、城市法规、房地产市场的走向，以及他们是否应该承担风险。这就更难了。

The next level up might be someone who’s managing money in a real estate fund. They have an enormous amount of capital leverage. They’re dealing with lots and lots of developers, and they’re buying huge amounts of housing inventory. [74]
下一级可能是在房地产基金管理资金的人。他们拥有巨大的资本杠杆。他们正在与许许多多的开发商打交道，他们正在购买大量的房屋库存。

One level beyond that might be somebody who says, “Actually, I want to bring the maximum leverage to bear in this market and the maximum specific knowledge.” That person would say, “Well, I understand real estate, and I understand everything from basic housing construction, to building properties and selling them, to how real estate markets move and thrive, and I also understand the technology business. I understand how to recruit developers, how to write code, and how to build a good product, and I understand how to raise money from venture capitalists, how to return it, and how all of that works.”
更高一层的人可能会说，“实际上，我想在这个市场上发挥最大的杠杆作用和最大的具体知识。”那个人会说，“嗯，我了解房地产，我了解一切，从基本的住房建设，到建造和出售房产，再到房地产市场是如何运作和繁荣的，我也了解科技行业。我知道如何招募开发人员，如何编写代码，如何打造一个好的产品，我也知道如何从风险投资家那里筹集资金，如何返还资金，以及所有这些都是如何运作的。“
Obviously, not a single person may know this. You may pull a team together to do it where each have different skill sets, but that combined entity would have specific knowledge in technology and in real estate. It would have massive accountability because that company’s name would be a very high -risk , high -reward effort attached to the whole thing, and people would devote their lives to it and take on significant risk. It would have leverage in code with lots of developers. It would have capital with investors putting money in and the founder’s own capital. It would have some of the highest -quality labor you can find, which is high -quality engineers, designers, and marketers who are working on the company.

显然，没有一个人知道这一点。你可以召集一个团队来做这件事，每个团队都有不同的技能集，但合并后的实体将在技术和房地产方面拥有特定的知识。它将承担巨大的责任，因为该公司的名称将是一个非常高风险，高回报的努力，整个事情，人们会献身于它，并承担重大风险。它将在大量开发人员的代码中发挥杠杆作用。它将拥有投资者投入的资本和创始人的自有资本。它将拥有一些你能找到的最高质量的劳动力，即在公司工作的高素质工程师、设计师和营销人员。

Then, you may end up with a Trulia, Redfin, or Zillow company, and then the upside could potentially be in the billions of dollars, or the hundreds of millions of dollars. [78]
然后，你可能会得到一家Trulia，Redfin或Zillow公司，然后潜在的收益可能是数十亿美元，或者数亿美元。

Each level has increasing leverage, increasing accountability, increasingly specific knowledge. You’re adding in money -based leverage on top of labor -based leverage. Adding in code -based leverage on top of money and labor allows you to actually create something bigger and bigger and get closer and closer to owning all the upside, not just being paid a salary.

每一级都有越来越多的杠杆作用，越来越多的责任，越来越具体的知识。你在劳动力杠杆的基础上增加了货币杠杆。在金钱和劳动力的基础上增加基于代码的杠杆，可以让你真正创造出越来越大的东西，并越来越接近拥有所有的好处，而不仅仅是拿到工资。

You start as a salaried employee. But you want to work your way up to try and get higher leverage, more accountability, and specific knowledge. The combination of those over a long period of time with the magic of compound interest will make you wealthy. [74]
你是从一名受薪员工开始的。但你要努力向上，尝试获得更高的杠杆率、更多的责任感和具体的知识。长期来看，这些与复利的魔力相结合，会让你变得富有。

The one thing you have to avoid is the risk of ruin.

你必须避免的一件事是破产的风险。

Avoiding ruin means stay out of jail. So, don’t do anything illegal. It’s never worth it to wear an orange jumpsuit. Stay out of total catastrophic loss. Avoiding ruin could also mean you stay out of things that could be physically dangerous or hurt your body. You have to watch your health.
避免毁灭意味着远离牢狱之灾。所以，不要做任何违法的事。穿橙色连体裤从来都不值得。远离全部的灾难性损失。避免毁灭也可能意味着你远离那些可能对身体造成危险或伤害身体的事情。你必须注意你的健康。

Stay out of things that could cause you to lose all of your capital, all of your savings. Don’t gamble everything on one go. Instead, take rationally optimistic bets with big upsides. [78]
不要插手那些可能会让你损失所有资本、所有积蓄的事情。不要把所有的东西都赌上一次。取而代之的是，采取理性乐观的押注，并有很大的上行空间。
